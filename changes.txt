 Changes from Original Pop'N'Fresh's Max6 Plugin:
----------------------------------------

Version 1.0
-------------

- Correct normals exporting with support for smoothing groups (with mesh subdivision) and edited normals.
- Correct shader paths. Now counting textures/ and gfx/ for root path and converting backslashes.
- Consistent UV exporting (reading vertex channels) allowing usage of COLLADA
- Advanced export messages/warnings handling.
- Warnings for null/nullshader materials
- Not writing null skins anymore but "noshader" instead as most MD3 loaders expects at least 1 skin.
- Bound boxes and culling radius for frames.
- Fixing lazy mesh names "Cylinder01", "Box02" to "base", "base2" etc. with a warning.
- Removed relative tag alignment.
- More consistent with MD3 spec.
- Defaulting to "0" frame range when exporting.
- Export names as lowercase.
- Ability to export multimaterials (only first texture layer)
- Export several .md3s from one scene (for each object, model get suffixed by object name)
- Export tag_pivot for object pivot position
- Generation of sample .shader file
- Export "collision"/"shadow" mesh
- Objects beginning from * are always ignores
- Can use materialname as shadername if it contains '/' character
